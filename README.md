I need to get sound and video frame from video file

It is not simple, usually this task stands on video recording from camera. And no one getting it from video and putting it into one.

For task I need:

1. get video frame
2. compare it
3. delete same things
4. record it
5. cut correct audio file
6. record audio over video

will use ffmpeg, opencv, moviepy for now.
